============================

The Tiny ICD (TICD) framework is a small example implementaiton of a task
message handler. The main goal of TICD is to simplify the task parsing of
application devices in low-level embedded devices. TICD does not concern itself
with transmission hardware or network protocols and can used with any
communication medium available to the system.
